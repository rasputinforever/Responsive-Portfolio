## Week 2 Homework - About Me Website ##

# Purpose: 
This website demonstrates several exciting development tools
1) Bootstrap implementation.
2) Media Screen CSS "events".
3) The interaction between Bootstrap and Local styling settings.
4) Create many commits to track changes as granularly, yet focused, as possible. (Still learning how to do this effectively)

# Bootstrap:
Bootstrap was used to create the Navigation Bar, footer, and the grid by which the page elements are organized. The pages link to both the CSS and JS links from bootstrap.

Additionally, ensuring there is a Javascript link to Bootstrap ensures pre-built tools work, such as the "toggle" button on the Nav-bar.

# Local CSS:
In "style.css" we have page-specific stylings for the page as well as the @Media settings. Each page should appear different at full-size, medium-sized, and small-sized. The main "container" should shrink, the images should size appropriately, and at each of the three thresholds the pages should appear in a pleasing way.

# Priority in Styling:
Knowing how to apply stylings to IDs versus CLASSes, first, is key in ensuring the correct stylings apply in any given view, but even more importantly, which take priority between views. Competing with Bootstrap and between various CSS style settings for the same element between @media thresholds.

# Commits
It's very easy to commit and push. It's even easier to get ahead of one's self and create many unrelated changes all at once. It's tempting to create short commit messages. This is an ongoing issue.
