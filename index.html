        Erik Portillo is an aspiring developer. He has spent many hours creating workflow solutions for his laboratory within excel. Excel is a great platform to learn about design and even coding with its VBA functionality. Excel, however, is not a secure platform for wide use. It is not accessible as only one person can access and interact with a file at one time. It is also a resource hog, eating up a lot of resources to perform simple tasks as those tasks scale up. It's also easy to corrupt, big files may self-destruct, not only losing work, but losign the entire file! Web development for these tools makes so much more sense!

        Aside from development, Erik is a chemist, cook, and lover of cats. As a chemist Erik has been working in the private sector as an analytical chemist, performing routine analysis of various commodities for pesticides and other interesting compounds. Erik was a cook in his past, working in both fine dining and casual dining and since has become mostly a hobbyist. With the advent of YouTube it's become even easier to learn new recipes and techniques. As a lover of cats Erik has been lucky to have been in the company of many cute cats.

        Erik is also a fan of Star Trek.
