                Erik Portillo has a lot to say about Star Trek. One of his favorite shows is Star Trek and he considers Star Trek: Deep Space nine to be the best of the shows. With all respect paid to the Original Series and The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine takes the established universe and expands on the kinds of interpersonal and interspecies conflicts that can arise even for a so-called utopian society when they still persue knowledge in the great unknown. The fact that there isn't a lot of "trekking" of space, the crew and persons on Deep Space Nine still manage to find themselves learning about new species, customs, and themselves. It's a great show that should not be overlooked.

                Star Trek has changed quite a bit since Star Trek Enterprise left the small screen prematurely in the early 2000s. That would be the last of the "Berman" era shows which, though not perfect, still adhered as best it could to the ideals Gene Roddenberry established way back on the original and Next Generation serires. Star Trek, since the 2009 J.J. Abrams, has pivoted to be more main-stream with a feel and tone that edges somewhat closer to what Star Wars is all about. Instead of self-reflection, characterization, and telegraphing very clear questions of morality, new-Trek (as it's called) is more about action and adventure. People really like that, which makes it good for some, but for old fans it's bittersweet knowing that a return to the classic formula and format may have to wait until this generation of Trek sputters out and the next generation, so to speak, returns.
