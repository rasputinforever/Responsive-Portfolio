        The journey begins in a far away place, in a time long ago, when the world was still innocent. It's a pretty boring story, actually, so let's just fast forward a bit: this morning I decided to skip breakfast. Too far? Ok, ok, well, let's pick an arbitrary year... how about 2010. Yes, 2010: I just moved to Portland, Oregon and I was taking it all in. There was a particular event that I think really informed the person I'd become today. I was approached by an older man, gaunt, wearing a worn-out mumu. He was quite tall as well, and I quite short, so as he approached my instinct kicked it and I looked around for a way out of the situation. He called out toward me, "Good sir! My foot has sent me a communication!" This was obviously quite a perplexing thing to say, as I reflect upon it all these years later, but I couldn't help but look down upon his foot where I saw it: his big toe. Fully exposed, sticking out of his crocks, through his worn out grey socks, was that infernal toe staring back up to me with its yellow nail, black grime around the cuticles, sitting crookedly as it dangled out of whatever lied within the sock itself...

        OH. Oh, I'm sorry. This is the "Response Portfolio". Silly me, I thought this was "Repulisve Old Man's Toe." Terribly sorry! Here are some links relevant to my career which I'm sure will both delight... and distrub.
